1) What is the program?
#include <iostream>

int addNumbers (int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main ()
{
   int a = 10;
   int b = 5;
   int c;

  std::cout<<"Statement1"<<std::endl;
  std::cout<<"Statement2"<<std::endl;
 
  c = addNumbers(a,b);
  std::cout << "Statement 3" <<std::endl;
  std::cout	 << "Statement 4" <<std::endl;

return 0;
}


2) Compiler converts into binary executable (CPU Understands)
	how to view?  cant open roooster.exe	//cannot be read by ide
		way to view assembly code, disassembler
			gcc -S helloworld.c


3) Where is program stored? Somewhere on harddrive (binary format)
4) where is data stored in Memory?
	0) Disks: Magnetic tapes/floppies/CDs/DVDs/Bluray/HDD/SSD
	1) main memory (DRAM and DDR Family)
	2) Caches
	3) Registersa
4) Where is program executed? RAM
	How memory is allocated and used by program	(Memory model)
	a ) when we double click file etc
	b ) file loaded in memory (not stored)
		//id : session #			
		RAM	//loaded program					CPU Memory
		0001	a=10 (int)
		0002	b=5(int)
		0003	c (int)
		0004 	print("statement1") 
		0005	print("statement2")
		0006	c = f_add(a,b)		------->			0001  RET = 0006	//stores 6 in return m	
		0007	print("statement3")
		0008	print("statement4")
		0009
		0010
		.....

		
	c)		//CPU runs program
		0020	10	//a
		....	 5	//b
			xxx	//c//junk  //prints statement 1 and 2 on console


				//function is stored somewhere away //cpu needs to reference return address in CPU memory
		0030	10	//param1
		.....	5	//param2		
			Param1 + Param2	//prints statement 3 and 4 on console

for simple addition have to go to very far memory location? Solution?
CPU Optimizes function call to nearest(20 our case). How?( Inline function)
