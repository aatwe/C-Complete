What is std cout/cin? Stream / highway connecting program and terminal
	Technical what is cin? object of class iostream

program---------std::cout---------Terminal

why <<  and >>
std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;	//data going from program to std:;cout

1) How to get data from terminal(console) to program (Read)
std::cin>>name;	//data stored in name variable
	
	Can we chain std::cin? Yes
	std::cin >> name >> age;	//What input into? name and age variable
				//Takes successive inputs


2) How to get output from program to terminal(console) )(Print)
std::cout<<"Printing on terminal"	

//When are the below statements useful? Terminal programs that support features to format different messages
3) std::cerr
	errors to console
	std::cerr << "Error message : Something is wrong" << std::endl;

	What is output? Error message : Something is wrong
4) std::clog
	log messages to console
	std::clog << "Log message : Something happened" << std::endl;
	
	What is output? Log message : Something happened

5) std::string


6) Why cant we pass data with spaces?  cin object skips spaces
What happens if we do?
	for ex
		cin >> name >>age1;	
		Daniel Gakwaya
	
		Output only Daniel


 How to pass in data with spaces?
std::string full_name;
   std::getline(std::cin, full_name);
