What Types of errors in C++ Programs
	What is final goal of C++ Program -> generate binary executable
		How to generate binary executable? run code through compiler
			Can compiler run any code? NO
			What requirements/rules compiler have?
			What if we break rules? CT Errors, RT Errors and Warnings

Ex Code
#include<iostream>

int main() {
   std::cout <<"Hello World in C++20"!" << std :: endl		//no semicolon
  return 0;
}

1) Compile Time Errors
cannot generate binary executable	//code will not compile
				//incorrect syntax
semicolon before return statement is missing
//program didnt run
What are compile time errors? syntactical + Semantic
Who detects CT Errors? Compiler
When detected? during compilation
Example: missing ;
	//It wont compile 


2) Runtime Errors
can generate binary executable but logical error in program //code will compile
						//correct syntax
program will fail/terminate immediately		//program crash
//program 
What are runtime errors? errors detected at time of running program only 
	for ex memory leak.
Who detects RT Errors? Virtual machine
When detected? when program running
Example: 7/0
	//it wont be able give output and will terminate / fail

3) Warnings

can generate binary executable //code will compile
program runs but with warnings
What are warnings? message to warn us
