Q) What is a variable? named piece of memory
	What are variable naming convention? cannot start with number	
					can use underscore
					spaces+specialchar  not allowed
	Are variables case sensitive? yes   int var1 vs int Var1

Q) Why use variable? can store different types of data in it
			can do operations with that data

Q) What are integer variables? variables/piece of memory that store whole numbers

Q) How much size integer variables occupy? 4 bytes in memory

Q) What ex of integer variable? int age;

Q) How to declare integer variable?
  
	typename variable_name {initializer_value};	//braced
						//similar for functional and assignment

			braced	        Functional		Assignment
Q) How to initialize integer?    {} 	or 	() 	or	       =
	{} vs () vs =
	int var() vs int var{} 
	int var(2.9);	//turns 2.9 to 2	//implicit conversions 	
	int var{2.9};	//shows errors/warnings
	int var = 2.9;	
int ants;	//initializes as garbage value

int dodo2();  //
int dodo{}; //initializes to zero by default

int dog_count {10};	//initializes to 10

int cat_count {15};	//initializes to 10


Q) How to use expression to initialize?
int pet_animals = { dog_count{10} + cat_count{15}};


Q) What if we use undefined/undeclared variables? Compilation error //Rules break //program wont run
int bad_initialization { doesnt_exist1 + doesnt_exist2};

Q) What if we store fractional number in integer variable? Error/warning
					can store but size problem -> data might be lost (fractional number size > integer size)
int narrowing_conversion {2.9};

Q) How to get/query size of integer data type/ integer variable? sizeof(int)   or sizeof(var1);
	4 bytes
