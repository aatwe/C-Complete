How to pass parameters to functions?

1) function creates local copy of age variable
2) local copy contains argument passed to the function
3) local copy dies when out of scope
/try printing address of local and outside varaible and check
outside variable before and after same value same address
local variable at a new address(proof that copy) -> new value

//Summary: remmeber that what var you working on in the body of function is a copy passed as argument when function was called

What input function takes? value as argument

void say_age(int age);		//Declaration

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int age{23};
  std::cout<< age << std::endl;
  say_age(age);			//pass age as argument
  std::cout<< age << std::endl;
 
  return 0;
}

void say_age(int age) {		//Defintiion	//age as parameter //copy of variable age
   ++age;
   std::cout<<age; 
}
