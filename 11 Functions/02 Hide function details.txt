What if you dont want to expose the function details?
How to separate function header from implementation? separate into 2 parts, declaration and definition
	What is declaration? also called prototype //without body

What if only declaration provided, no definition: Compiler error: undefined reference
Function  DECLARATION

 int max (int a, int b);	//prototype
	When&where to place prototype/declaration? before function call in file
		if not- > compiler error	
	
	If place function definition before main -> it also works as declaration

 int main(int argc. char**argv){
  int a{3};
  int b{4};

std::cout<< max(a,b);
std::cout<< min(a,b);

 return 0;
}

//are var name compulsory for function declaration? No , only needed in definition, because they have use there
int max (int, int);	//Valid

//Function DEFINITION / implementation	//People dont care about this, they want to use
int max (int a, int b){
  if(a>b)
	return a;
  else
	returb b;
}
