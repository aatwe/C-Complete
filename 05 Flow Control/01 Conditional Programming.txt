	police_stop
			true /. false


//initialize the conditions		
bool red = false;	
bool green {true};
bool yellow {false};
bool police_stop{true};


//Do logical things  based on conditions

if (red) {
  std::cout<<"Stop"<<std::endl;
}
if (yellow) {
  std::cout<<"Slow down"<<std::endl;
}
if (green) {
  std::cout<<"Go"<<std::endl;
}
