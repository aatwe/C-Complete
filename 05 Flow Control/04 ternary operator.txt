What are ternary operators?

result = (condition)? option1 : option2;
          if condn true 
	  excute result = option1 
	else 
 	  execute result = option 2

1) 
	//if else based on condition
if (a > b){
   max = a;
} else {
   max = b;
}

2) 	//xTernary operator
max = (a>b)?a : b;

//What data type a and b? either same or convertible
	if not compiler error


ex case: IMPLICIT CONVERSION

int a{35};
int b{200};
auto max1 = (a > b)? a : 22.5f;
Output: 22
what are we comparing? a(int) b (float)
	compiler implicitly converts float to int

How implicit conversion was done?What type compiler used? how to find what type compiler used?
auto max1 = (a>b)? a : 22.5f  
Output max1 : 22.5		//conversion happened from int to float actually
