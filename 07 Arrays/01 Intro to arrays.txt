What data we have been working with? single integer variables


How to work with multiple variables and manipulate under 1 variable name?
Arrays

How memory allocated for array? contagious 

Why array? group variables and manipulate as 1 unit / reference with single entity

How to refer to multiple variables? [] index
	What is starting index of array? 0

DECLARE ARRAY
int scores[10];	//10 integers grouped into 1 logical entity scores
		//memory allocated
		//unintialized array variables contain? garbage data

Can we declare array as const?Yes, cant modify elements of that array then
    Try modifying
	const int multipliers [] {22,3015};
	multipliers[1] = 20;	//Compiler error

SIZE OF ARRAY
if we give 10 elements in array	
   Can we read outside this array? Yes  but problems crash etc
	you'll be reading memory not allocated to array

  Can we put only 3 elements in size 5 array? yes, rest will be 0
  Can we skip not specifying size? Yes,compiler deduces. how? auto var : array_name
	for ex. print size of class_sizes
							//range based for loop
							//no iterator etc needed //just read and use value
				


 	int class_sizes[] = {10,12,15,11,18,17};
	for (auto value: class_sizes){
		std::cout<<value;

//Range based for loop use case
int scores[] {2,5,8,2,5,6,9};	
	int sum {0};
	for (int element : scores) {
	  sum += element;
}


READ DATA FROM ARRAY
1) read individual element
	usind index : score[1];

2) read all data in array?
	use index with incrementing iterator (for loop)
	for (size_t i{0}; i< 10 ; i ++){
	  std::cout<< scores[i] ;
}

WRITE DATA IN ARRAY
1) individual data
	assign data to element using index
	scores[0] = 10;

2) multiple elements : for loop and incrementing iterator
	for (size_t{0}; i<10; ++i){
	  scores[i] = i*3;
}
  //Can we modify already present data in array? Yes
	const int multipliers [] {22,30,15};
	multipliers[1] = 20;


DECLARE AND INITIALIZE ARRAY  

double salaries[5] = {12.7,7.5,13.2,8.1,9.3};

//print
for(size_t{0}; i<5; ++i){
  std::cout<<	salaries[i];
}


OPERATIONS ON DATA IN ARRAY
for ex add elements of array	
	int scores[] {2,5,8,2,5,6,9};	
	int sum {0};
	for (int element : scores) {
	  sum += element;
}
std::cout<< "Score sum : " << sum;
return 0;
