How to query size of array (What if an array keeps changing)
	//dont care for what no. you initiliazed array with
Solution:
  How to query at runtime?	
  std::size(array_name)	//size of all elements
  std::size(array_name[1])

  Where can we use?
  In loop
	for (size_t i{0}; i< std::size(scores); ++i) {	//advantage? now dont have to care how many elements we init array with,
	   std::cout<< scores[i];
}



What hack before std::size()?
size_t count {sizeof(scores)/ sizeof(scores[0])};	//get count of elements using size of //total array size/ individual element size			
					//use count in loop

Note: shortest trick is
range based for loop!

int scores [] ={10,12,15,11,17,19,24};

for (auto score : scores) {
	std::cout<< "score : " <<score ;
}
