What are bounds of array?
	bounds within which only we can store array elements
	any location other than specified for array is out of bounds

	When we declare array what is size of each element? specified by us or deduced by compiler
		and hence of array
	Only provided  locations are allowed to manipulated

	
	Any other memory location apart from specified: might be for other program or used by OS //BAD


	Does c++ allow to access  out of bounds? Yes

	Can we modify data beyond bounds? Yes but careful	
			even if you change someother program might change it again
