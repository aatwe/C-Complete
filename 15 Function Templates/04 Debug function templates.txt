Q) What if we debug a program with fn templates in debugger? cppinsights alternative
Q) How to find what template instances were generated by the program
 template <typename T>
T maximum(Ta , Tb){
   return (a > b)? a : b;
}
int main(){
   int x{5};
   int y{7};
  auto result = maximum(x,y);	//implictly convert to int	//use auto if correct result needed -> compiler deduces from return type of instance
  std::cout<<result;
   return 0;
}


Ans.
1) set break point at function call
2) Run tab -> Debugging tools
    -> green play button
    Binary gets passed to debugger

Locals
  a : 5
  b : 7


WATCH

CALL STACK
  Thread		Paused on breakpoint
     main()		main.cpp
  Thread #2	Paused
  Thread #3	Paused
  Thread #4	Paused

Click step into ->
  from auto result = maximum(x,y); --> jumps into ---> return(a>b)? a : b
	//locals wont show type on top why? this is only function template
	
Where can we see info about types?
Check callstack
CALL STACK
  Thread		Paused on breakpoint
     maximum<int>(int a, int b)	//info about types		//can check here what template instances were generated
     main()		main.cpp					//if we change parameters to double, this will also show double

  Thread #3	Paused
  Thread #4	Paused
