How to use? with parenthesis
why use parenthesis?
	if stid::cout << number1< number2;																			
What operators are used in this case? << and <
	precedance table : << has higher precedance than <
	//compiler will print number1 in stream and then encounter < operator
		//problem
	solution? use parenthesis

 

int number1 {45};
int number2 {60};
std::cout << std::boolalpha;	//why bool alpha? output format to true/false instead of 1/0

std::cout << (number1 <number2 ) << std::endl;	 	//true
std::cout << (number1 >number2 ) << std::endl;	 	//false
std::cout << (number1 <=number2 ) << std::endl;	 //true
std::cout << (number1 >=number2 ) << std::endl;	 //false
std::cout << (number1 !=number2 ) << std::endl;	 	 //true
std::cout << (number1 ==number2 ) << std::endl;	 //false
