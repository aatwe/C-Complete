What are logical operators?
Operators that work on boolean operands

&& 	//And
	F && F -> F
	F &&T -> F
	T &&F -> F
	T &&T -> T 

||	//Or
	F || F -> T
	F ||T -> T
	T ||F -> T
	T ||T -> F 


!	//not equal	//Negating operator
	T 	!T = F
	F	!F = T



Expressions may combine all 3
//check precedance & associativity
//put parenthesis to avoid confusion
