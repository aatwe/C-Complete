How to use heap storage to get additional memory?
 we use pointers to manipulate variables


STACK
	how much stack memory? finite
	What is memory lifetime? programmer not in control
	how is lifetime controlled? scope mech	//variable dies after scope ends

HEAP
	what is memory lifetime? programmer in control of when allocated & when released (return to OS)
	#include<iostream>
	int main(int argc, char**argv) {
	  {
		int local_var{33};		//dies
		int *local_ptr_var = new int;  //doesnt die, lives on heap after scoe
}
	return 0;
}

	how is lifetime controlled? new & delete operator



USING DYNAMIC MEMORY

//setup pointer
int *p_number4{nullptr};

//how to allocate memory	(new int)
//how to point and access it? p_number4
			//os will allocate memory on heap (how big memory? large enough for int) 
			//Can another program use? no other program can use

p_number4 = new int;
------------------------------------------

//how to release memory? (delete)
delete p_number4;

//After deleting set to nullptr	//implies no valid data in memory
p_number4 = nullptr

------------------------------------------
How to allocate and initialize in same statement?
int *p_number4 {new int};


What if we call delete twice on pointer? BAD
	p_number6 = new int{77};		//allocated memory location
	delete p_number6;			//return to system
	delete p_number6;			//CRASH
	p_number6 = nullptr;
