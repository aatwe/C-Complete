What is C++ Dev Workflow?

1) C++ Program in IDE ----> Compiler ---> binary executable(.exe)
2) binary executable(.exe) -------> Operating System(program loaded in memory RAM)------>	Stored in Program area section of memory


What is memory map(virtual memory)? the idea our program has of memory
	Standard format defined byOS. Why cant we run .exe from windows on linux? coz memory map
	All programs conform to memroy map for that OS	

Why program is not loaded on real memory? so many programs, can run out of memory.
	Virtual memory
		makes program think  it is the only 1 running on OS, all resources belong to it 	
		virtual memory view = memory map

	Program --> abstracted to Process
	each process has access to memory range 0 -2^n-1
			n = 32 on 32 bit system, 64 on 64 bit	//program thinks it owns all this memory	//Virtual Memory

	//Basically binary file will be representation of how things will be laid out in memory	(Memory Map)

What types of memory we have now?
1) RAM
2) Virtual Memory (0 - 2^n - 1)


What happens when we run the program?
Binary Executable (Memory Map) ---> Memory Management unit (CPU Section) ----> Real Memory


Is entire program loaded in real memory? No , only parts really needed
				     not required parst on hard-drive	//Complicated



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
What does memory map look like?

Sections of memory map

Stack	//imp	
	stores local variables

Heap	//imp
	additional memory
Data
