1)What is memory leak?
	What memory allcoated? heap 

	What if you forget to delete it after use?OS thinks still using it
	What if we cant access the memory /& object in it?
		Memory leak	

2) What memory leak effects? can lead to program crashing if program keeps running extended time
		program running for 3 months -> leaking memory => too much heap used -> terminate program

3) What precaution? When not using a memory , delet and return to OS
			//Safer C++
Ex1)
int *p_number {new int{67}};	//dynamic memory allocated

int number{55};		//which memory?stack memory allocated

			//assign stack memory address to dynamic memory pointer
p_number = &number;	//but p_number already has dynamic memory address allocated

What will happen?
where pointer pointing ? stack
did we delete/release dynamic memory before reassigning its pointer? No
Can we use that dynamic memory again? NO
Can OS use that dynamic memory again> No



Ex2) 
int *p_number1 {new int{55}};	//dynamically allocate memory

p_number1 = new int{44};		//point pointer to new memory	
				lose access to first, data lost


Ex3) 
#include <iostream>
int main (int argc, char **argv)
{

{
	int *p_number2 {new int{52}};
}					//What when scope ends? p_number2 pointer dies, dynamic memory wont die
					//Cant access 52 again
					//Memory leak
}
