What is Do While loop

ITERATOR: 
where declared and initialized
outside do and while loop on top

What if iterator COUNT is 0
runs once

BODY:
inside do loop

INCREMENT: 
inside do loop

TEST:
inside while loop
  what after test is not true: exit after do while


const unsigned int  COUNT {10};
unsigned int i {0};				//Initialization
do {
	std::cout<<"I Love C++" << std::endl;	//Body
	++i; 				//Increment
} while (i < COUNT);			//TEST
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
//Do while vs  While()
//Will atleast run once
1) Runs body code
2) Tests
