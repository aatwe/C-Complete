What is while loop

SYNTAX:
  unsigned int i {0};
	while(i < COUNT){
		  std::cout << "I love C++" <<std::endl;
		 ++i;	
}


ITERATOR
//Where declared and initialized? outside of loop
unsigned int i {0};




TEST
i < COUNT

INCREMENT/DECREMENT
//Where increment/decrement : Inside while loop in Body


LOOP BODY
//What after body executed? Check test again
	if test true : Run body again
	if test false : exit while loop



Comparing while loop and for loop
1) while loop iteration is in body
2) When to use for?     when know how many iterations
    When to use while? when dont know how many iterations and only know condition
3) for loop initialization :  once done is not repeated
    while loop	        :  initialization if done in condition check , gets repeated
4)for     iteration: only after body statements executed
   while iteration: anywhere in loop
