What is inheritence?
Feature C++ provides that allow us to buildclasses that depend on each other
	and form a cluster

	Build Hierarchy of classes : Classes depending on other classes

Why Inheritence? Makes design much easier to look and understand
Why need hierarchy of class?
	Suppose we have type : Person
		We can have different types of person
			For ex
				Doctor
				Physician
				Engineer

How to capture these relationships? Inheritance

How make hierarchy

One class person
Other classes Engineer depending on Person
Other classes CivilEng depending on Engineer

What Engineer is adding? Adding a layer over Person type
What is Civil Engineer adding? A layer over Engineer type 


Inheritence,Classes are defining feature of OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
	What is OOP? way to think about programming in terms of objects
