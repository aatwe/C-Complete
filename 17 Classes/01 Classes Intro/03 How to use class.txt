int main() {
// Howset up class variables(object)? Typename varname
  Cylinder cylinder1; 

// What do objects contain? runtime data
	for ex cylinder1.height = 8 ;	//runtime information stored in cylinder 1

//How to call member function? dot notation
  std::cout<<cylinder1.volume();

//How to modify member variables/functions?
 cylinder.base_radius = 3.0;
 cylinder.height = 2;

// How to call member function with updated values?dotnotation
 std::cout<<cylinder.volume() << std:;endl;  
}

//Where are member variables stored? stack

//What can be member variables? stack var, pointers , but NOT references
	Why member variables cant be references? reference cant be left uninitialized
	In class imp to have ability leave var uninitialized


Q) Are class members private or public by default? 
	private by default
	   implies? not accessible from outside class (for ex main)


How to check? remove public keyword
What if class is private? cannot use volume from outside (main)
		Error:Classname:method inaccessible
class Cylinder {
//public
	double base_radius {1.0};
	double height {1.0};
	return PI*base_radius*base_radius*height;
//public
	double volume() {	
}}
    Are they accessible from inside of class? Yes


Should member variables be private orpublic?  private
users care about member functions not member variables
Solution? member variables: private, member functions: public
