
HOW TO DECLARE CLASS



For ex how to model a cylinder?
What info we have about cylinder?
	Cylinder has r and h

class Cylinder {
public :	//Define member variables(define what class is) for cylinder	//what is public? members(in this class) are accessible from outside of class
  double base_radius {1.0};	
  double height {1.0};

public :	//Define member functions(behaviour) for cylinder
  double volume() {
	return PI*base_radius*base_radius*height;
}
};

What is default value of member variables? 0
