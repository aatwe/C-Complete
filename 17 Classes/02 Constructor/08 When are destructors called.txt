 When are destructors called?
		When explicitly called
		if object passed by value to function -> destructor called?
			copy in local scope of function 
			when function exit -> local copy killed
		if local object returned from function -> destructor called 

OBVIOUS cases:
		if local stack object went out of scope
		if heap object is released from memory (delete)
