What is struct? Another syntax to create classes in C++

How to create classes ?
	Class keyword
	Struct

how to create class?
class Dog{
	std::string name{"none"};
};


Q) how to create structure
struct Cat {
	std::string name;
}

Q) What is main difference between structure and class?
	Members can be directly accessed from outside
	  why?
		struct members : public
		class members : private
     Are class members private or public? private by default
     Are struct members private or public by default? public by default
	Can be accessed by outside

Q) How to change this default behaviour?
	explictly declare public/private
Q) Where are struct commonly used?
	setup classes with only public member variables and no methods inside class

#include <iostream>

class Dog {
	std::string m_name;
};

struct Cat 
{
	std::string m_name;
}

int main() {
	Dog dog1;
	Cat cat1;
	
	dog1.m_name = "Fluffy";	//Error
	cat1.m_name= "Juny";	//Not error
}
How to use structure?

class Dog {
	std::string m_name;
};

struct Point {
   double x;
   double y;
};

void print_point (const Point &point);
{
	std::cout<< point.x <<point.y;	
}
int main() {
	Dog dog1;
	Cat cat1;
	dog1.m_name = "Fluffy";
	cat1.m_name = "Juny";
	std::cout<< dog1.m_name <<std::endl;
	std::cout<< cat1.m)name << std::endl;

	Point point1;
	point1.x = 10;
	point1.y = 55.55;	 
	print_point(point1);	
	point1.x = 40.4;
	point1.y= 2.7;

	return 0
